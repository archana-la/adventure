        <h2>Check out our top treks in Nepal</h2>
        <p>Since the day Nepal came into light in the eyes of the world, nothing has attracted the world more than its snow clad mountains of highest elevations. The sources say that 90% of the tourists who land in Nepal for leisure purpose trek on the foothills of these mountains. The trekking picked up in Nepal mostly in the 1980â€™s and in the Annapurnas. Within no time and in matter of 4 decades, Annapurna now is entirely inhabited and there are several other regions in Nepal which offer similar and even more pristine experience.</p>
     
       <p>As of this day, several trails have been developed in the Everest region, Manaslu region, Ganesh Region, Langtang Region, Dhaulagiri Region and also some off the beaten treks in the further western corner of Nepal. All in all, there is a trek for just everyone, be it children, differently abled, senior citizen, travellers in a hurry or travellers with time in abundance. Trekking is a way to explore not only mountains but also its biodiversity. On top, you get to see lifestyle of various indigenous tribes inhabiting on the trails of these mountains. If you are ready to embark on a adventure full of mountains, wildlife, cultural traditions and stories, then explore Nepal's beauty with us here!</p>
